### More about this repo

* This is effectively `create-react-app` with a little clean up, some styles, and some packages to make getting up and running with GraphQL easier.
* All code regarding making queries and rendering stuff goes down in the `/components` folder.
* All code regarding setting up the app goes down in `index.js` and `App.js`.
